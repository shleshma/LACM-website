<div class="about-LA">
    The Bachelor Program is a time that shapes student’s future choices, not
    just about their careers but also about the way their minds perceive,
    process and use the knowledge at their disposal. For students who choose a
    career in the fast paced and constantly changing environment of the business
    and technological world, Little Angels’ College of Management reproduces
    real world challenges as best as it can in the classroom.
  <br />
  <br />
    The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and the Bachelor of Business
    Information Systems (BBIS) are both 120 credit, 4-year courses. The length
    of the course are divided for maximum impact into Foundation courses, Core
    Management courses, Concentration courses, Elective courses and an
    Internship to round it all up. During the course, students will develop
    administrative and problem solving skills with a sharp knowledge of today’s
    technology, preparing them for a lifetime of opportunities.
  <br />
  <br />
    Both the BBA and BBIS courses are affiliated to the internationally
    recognized and highly reputed Kathmandu University School of Management
    (KUSOM) and with LA’s signature hands on approach, students will be well on
    their way to a successful future.
  <br />
  <br />
    For students aspiring to join Nepal’s hospitality industry, LA’s Bachelor in
    Hospitality Management (BHM) is the perfect place to put your foot in the
    door. The four-year course trains students in the core lessons of performing
    in the hospitality industry with emphasis on communication skills, an
    absolute necessity in a business of making people feel welcome. Facilities
    such as an advanced kitchen, to train in culinary arts and a fully stocked
    bar where students will learn to prepare beverages are combined with
    sporting activities and a massive library to ensure a well rounded
    experience.
